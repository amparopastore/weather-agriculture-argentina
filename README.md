# Impact of Precipitation on Wheat, Corn, and Soybean Yield in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1993 - 2022)

Argentina is a country highly dependent on its agricultural sector, which represents a significant part of its economy. The province of Buenos Aires is among the most important agricultural regions, producing a significant portion of the country's crops. However, agricultural production in this region is highly vulnerable to changes in weather patterns, particularly rainfall.

In recent years, the impact of rainfall on agricultural production has become a topic of increasing concern in Argentina. As reported by Agrositio, the dry climate and high temperatures have been affecting crop yields and impacting the profitability of farmers in these regions.

This project aims to analyze the impact of precipitations on agricultural production in Argentina's most important agricultural region, where alternative irrigation methods are limited. Our primary goal is to examinate how strong of a correlation, if any, there is between precipitations and crop yield, and assess whether it is a good predictor for crop yield.
